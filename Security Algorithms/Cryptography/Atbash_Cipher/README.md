## **Atbash Cipher**
The [Atbash cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash) is a monoalphabetic cipher formed by taking the alphabet (or abjad, syllabary, etc.) and mapping it to its reverse, so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on.
