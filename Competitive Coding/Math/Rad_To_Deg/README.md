Radian : The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. The length of an arc of a unit circle is numerically equal to the measurement in radians of the angle that it subtends. One radian is just under 57.3 degrees.

Degree : A degree (in full, a degree of arc, arc degree, or arcdegree), usually denoted by ° (the degree symbol), is a measurement of a plane angle, defined so that a full rotation is 360 degrees.

The relation 2pi*rad = 360° can be derived using the formula for arc length.

An arc of a circle with the same length as the radius of that circle subtends an angle of 1 radian. The circumference subtends an angle of 2pi radians.
Therefore the formula is:

	degree = radian * (180/pi)
		where, pi = 22/7
